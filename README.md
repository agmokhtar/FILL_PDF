In this example, the code reads a pdf template and modifies it. When opening the file within the code, the change (new name) shows up in AcrobatReader. 
However, when closing the PDF file without any change in AcrobatReader, a prompt asks "Would you like to save the changes?"... 
The question is why the changes that the Python code does are not saved?
